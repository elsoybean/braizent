# Side Dish Pairing Rules Library

This document contains standardized side dish pairing rules that can be referenced by multiple skills (suggest-meal, quick-meal-pick, meal-planner, etc.) to ensure consistency and enable fast model execution.

**Purpose:** Provide explicit, mechanical pairing rules so fast models can suggest appropriate sides without requiring creative reasoning.

**Usage:** Skills should reference this file and apply rules mechanically based on cuisine type.

## How to Use These Rules

1. **Identify main dish cuisine** (from recipe tags or name)
2. **Check if main includes starch/vegetables** (read recipe)
3. **Apply pairing rules** for that cuisine
4. **Use quick side templates** for preparation instructions

## Decision Algorithm

**For fast models to apply mechanically:**

```
1. Read main dish cuisine tag
   IF missing, infer from recipe name

2. Read main dish to check if complete
   Complete = includes starch AND vegetable

3. IF main is complete:
   Suggest 1 simple side (bread or salad)

4. IF main lacks starch:
   Apply starch rule for cuisine

5. IF main lacks vegetable:
   Apply vegetable rule for cuisine

6. IF main lacks both:
   Suggest starch + vegetable for cuisine

7. Check equipment coordination
   Suggest sides using different equipment when possible

8. Format output using quick side templates
```

## Notes for Skills

**When to use these rules:**
- quick-meal-pick: ALWAYS use these template rules (mechanical)
- suggest-meal: Use as default, but can be creative if user asks
- meal-planner: Use for routine days, can be creative for featured days

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent suggestions across skills
- ✅ Fast model can apply mechanically
- ✅ User learns predictable patterns
- ✅ Easy to customize/extend

**Customization:**
- Users can manually edit this file
- Add their preferred side dish patterns
- Adjust cooking times for their equipment
- Add regional variations
